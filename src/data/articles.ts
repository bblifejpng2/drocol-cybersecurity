    intro:
      "The Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023 is Nigeria's first standalone data protection statute. It replaced the 2019 NDPR regulation, created the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) as an independent regulator, and applies to every organization that processes the personal data of people in Nigeria — including organizations based outside the country. Three years in, the NDPC is enforcing at an accelerating pace, and 2026 has brought sharper scrutiny to fintech, healthcare, and government-facing processors. Non-compliance can cost up to 2% of annual gross revenue or NGN 10 million, whichever is greater. This guide walks through what the Act actually requires in practice, and the gaps we most often find when assessing Nigerian organizations.",
